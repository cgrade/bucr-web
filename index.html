                <h2>About</h2>

                <p>My name is Abraham Elijah, and I work as a Chef at The Zuma Grill Restaurant, Transcorp Hilton Hotel ABuja FCT.
                    I have been working there for over 5 years, 
            and i noticed that there isn't a platform where our diner's could actually book for a reservation online before coming to the restaurant.
                i made couple of research, found out that there's nothing of such in Nigeria or even Africa as a whole.
                    that was how the Idea for Bucr was inspired. 
            This is a Portfolio Project for ALX Software Engineering, but i'm taking it further to become a Startup
                    as the application has a very large market to generate profits for Restaurant owners and founders alike.
